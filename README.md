## 🧩 UI/UX Design Decisions

This page was designed to help users choose the right skip size in a way that's simple and intuitive, even without images.

### Visual Design Philosophy

- **No images? No problem.**  
  Instead of adding skip illustrations, I used different card heights and colors to visually represent the sizes. This helps the user understand the difference at a glance without cluttering the page.

- **Color & Feel:**  
  I used a clean background with teal and warm gold accents to give the UI a professional, friendly feel. The layout is responsive, with the cards stacked vertically on mobile and arranged in a grid on larger screens.

- **Navigation:**  
  I removed the mobile navbar since the header items aren't clickable. The header stays static while the bold text and arrow show the user's current step.

- **Data Display:**  
  Each card pulls data from the API — showing the skip size and price (before VAT). Sizes range from 4 to 40, and the price changes based on the size. For now, I've focused on making these key details clear.

### Detailed Design Decisions

#### Color Palette

- **Primary**: Teal (#0f766e) - Professional and trustworthy
- **Accent**: Warm Gold (#f59e0b) - Friendly and approachable
- **Background**: Light Gray (#f9fafb) - Clean and modern
- **Success**: Green for road-allowed skips
- **Warning**: Orange for private property only
- **Info**: Blue for heavy waste capability

#### Visual Improvements

- **Size Indicators**: Horizontal bars that grow with skip size (4-yard = small green bar, 40-yard = large red bar)
- **Card Design**: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, hover effects with scale transforms
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with proper contrast ratios
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions using CSS transforms
- **Feature Badges**: Color-coded badges for road placement and heavy waste allowance

#### UX Enhancements

- **Visual Feedback**: Clear selected states with teal borders and rings
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states with retry options
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader support
- **Price Transparency**: Shows price breakdown (before VAT + VAT = total)
- **Feature Clarity**: Icons and badges clearly indicate skip capabilities

#### Mobile-First Approach

- **Responsive Grid**: Single column on mobile, 2 columns on tablet, 3 columns on desktop
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large tap targets and proper spacing
- **Readable Text**: Appropriate font sizes for mobile viewing
- **Sticky Navigation**: Breadcrumb stays visible while scrolling

## 🎨 Design System

### Component Architecture

- **SkipCard**: Individual skip selection cards with all features
- **SkipCardSkeleton**: Loading state placeholders
- **Breadcrumb**: Progress indicator showing current step
- **SkipSelector**: Main container managing state and layout
- **ErrorBoundary**: Graceful error handling

### Animation Strategy

- **Entrance**: Fade-in animations for initial load
- **Interaction**: Scale transforms on hover for tactile feedback
- **Transitions**: Smooth color and shadow transitions
- **Loading**: Pulse animations for skeleton states

## 🧪 Testing Approach

The project includes a testing setup with Vitest and React Testing Library:

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests** for utility functions and pure logic
- **Component Tests** for UI rendering and interactions
- **Hook Tests** for custom hooks and data fetching

### Test Coverage

Tests focus on critical functionality:

- Format utility functions (price formatting, date formatting)
- Component rendering and user interactions
- API data transformation and error handling
- Skip selection and validation logic

### Running Tests

\`\`\`bash

# Run tests once

npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode

npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report

npm run test:coverage
\`\`\`

### Test Structure

## 🔧 API Integration

### Real Data Consumption

The app fetches data from:
\`\`\`
https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location?postcode=NR32&area=Lowestoft
\`\`\`

### Data Transformation

- **Price Calculation**: Converts `price_before_vat` + VAT to final price
- **Feature Mapping**: Maps `allowed_on_road` and `allows_heavy_waste` to UI badges
- **Description Generation**: Creates user-friendly descriptions based on size and features
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when API is unavailable

### API Response Structure

\`\`\`typescript
interface SkipApiItem {
id: number
size: number
hire_period_days: number
price_before_vat: number
vat: number
allowed_on_road: boolean
allows_heavy_waste: boolean
transport_cost: number | null
per_tonne_cost: number | null
}
\`\`\`
